# Weather API with inclusion of Day 3 Addons for Collections and Environments
## Observations
I observed that the weather is hard to predict.
- I learned that the api documentation can be viewed in the right side of the postman website.
- I learned that using the postal code can give you the information you need about the weather in your area.
- This api required a key to use it as one of the parameters along with other data to pull the specific information.
- Creation of workspaces..
- Creation of collections.....
