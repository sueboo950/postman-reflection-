# GitHub API Requests Observations

In working with the different options to pull (get) the GitHub API was a flawless request with a status 200 ok without issues of retrieving my repository data. 

However, when it came to post (creating the repo), both in postman and thunderclient, I kept getting an error 404 with having my api key and needed criteria in place. Unsure of how to fix it.
